- Write a program to reverse a given integer number -
  -> he remainder of the number can be fetched and the number can be divided by 10 to remove the the digit in loop till number becomes 0
  -> A simple approach to reverse a number could also be to convert it in to a string and then reverse it



Challenges: 
  -> The remainder of the number can be fetched and the number can be divided by 10 to remove the the digit in loop till number becomes 0
  -> A simple approach to reverse a number could also be to convert it in to a string and then reverse it


Starter Code:
  const num = 3849;

  function reverseGivenInteger(num) {
      // write your solution here
      return;
  }

  console.log(`Reversed integer is: ${reverseGivenInteger(num)}`)
